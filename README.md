# katoolin
Automatically install all Kali linux tools

# Disclaimer about Forked version
This Fork has been created due to the fact that the original version has a lot of Pull requests with relevant fixes and improvements like compatibility with Python 3, typo fixes, link fixes, and so on, that have more than a year waiting for been applied to the master version and the original maintainer didn't apply those fixes for unknown reasons. The main idea is to receive the relevant pull requests for benefits of the users and if the maintainer decides in the near future to merge this fork applying the changes, it's ok! In another case, the project continues through this fork of the original project.
Note: I advertise through comments on some pull requests of the original project about this fork for contributors to bring their suggestions to this fork. When I have some time I will bring their suggestions for this project if they didn't.
